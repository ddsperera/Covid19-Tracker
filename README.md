# Covid19-Tracker
A tracker software that displays the global and country-wise count along with useful links for the same.

### Requirements :
Python 3, terminal or any IDE (vscode, pycharm)

### Introduction : 
In early December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. On January 30, 2020 the World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This outbreak has created a calamitous situation throughout the world. The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing day by day.

An infectious disease outbreak is the occurrence of a disease that is not usually expected in a particular community, geographical region, or time period. Typically, a rising infectious disease involves fast spreading, endangering the health of large numbers of people, and thus requires immediate action to prevent the disease at the community level. The symptoms of the infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. In more severe cases, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia and even death. The incubation period of COVID-19 can last for 2 weeks or longer. The virus can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets and close
contact. 

As some of the information available to the public may not be accurate, it becomes hard for people to find reliable sources and trustworthy guidance when they need it. Because of the high demand for appropriate and trustworthy information about SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 Tracker was created as a platform that provides the latest and verified news development, statistics and analysis on COVID-19. 

The main objective of this project is to collect data from verified sources such as WHO, Wikipedia, Hindustan Times, Worldometers, etc and display it to the user on a single window. It is projected towards enhancing the user interface for better convenience. It attempts to report the total number of cases, deaths, recovery, vaccinations administered, list of countries covid free, symptoms and treatments and the latest updates worldwide as well as all the affected countries.
